\section{Problem/Motivation}
\label{sec:Introduction:Motivation}

Path tracing is one of the most important rendering techniques when creating highly realistic pictures. It allows us to render the scene much closer to reality compared to typical scanline rendering methods at the cost of more computations. In situations where the images can be rendered ahead of time, such as for visual effects or films, we can take advantage of the better results of ray tracing. Then again, ray tracing is not yet useful for real-time applications like video games where the rendering speed is critical. But even regarding ray tracing, we cannot completely ignore the rendering time. Too long rendering times are becoming a problem in scenes with many lights. For instance, a scene that consists of a big city with skyscrapers at night could have hundreds or thousands of lights that could potentially all affect a single point in the scene. Lighting methods that calculate the incident lighting of a point for every single light in the scene would be too slow to deal with these kinds of scenes since every ray to the camera could potentially trace multiple points that all need to be lighted.

There are sampling approaches that try to limit the time required to render these scenes with a big amount of lights. For instance, we could say that the probability of a point of the scene sampling a certain light is only dependent on the emission power of said light. We would make a distribution that only takes into account the emission power of the lights. To light a specific point we would then sample a single light according to the distribution function we built earlier. Obviously there are a lot of problems with this approach. An area light source or a spotlight could be facing towards a completely different direction and may not have any effect on the point. Or the light source could be potentially too far away to have a noticeable effect on the point. This sampling technique asserts a fast sampling speed but can lead to very noisy images that we are trying to avoid.

For this bachelor's thesis we will introduce a light sampling technique that improves the rendering speed without making the rendered image too noisy.
